Whoa, just stepped out of the theater—mind's still reeling like that funhouse mirror scene where everything warps and bends. First thing, my back is literally crying for mercy after two hours in those medieval torture contraptions they call seats. Popcorn crumbs are sticking like glue to my jeans, and honestly, I feel like I should be waving a white flag instead of typing this.

That part where she's racing through the alleyway—felt like my dreams, the ones where you're running but everything feels like syrup. And that soundtrack! Like someone took a 90s Walkman energy drink and pumped it through a boombox. Honestly, by the time they got to the tower scene, my brain was all wait, did I download the movie already? Nah, just watching... just watching.

> Everything just hit me sideways when she opened the door and boom—parallel universe. That twist was like biting into what you thought was a chocolate chip cookie but it's raisins. You're half-annoyed, half-mesmerized. And the noise in that theater was unreal—like a choir of sneezes during the quiet parts, right when she's whispering that crucial line.

And that scene where they’re just staring at the sunset— it felt like when you're sipping a milkshake and you hit an air pocket, just that awkward pause before the sweet continues. The director was really playing mad scientist with the color palette, neon one second, gloomy concrete the next. My senses were doing backflips, like being on a roller coaster while trying to read a book.

Oh, and remember to tell Tom he can download the movie but honestly, watching is a whole different beast. Why do I feel like this movie just took a vacation in my brain and left its luggage? Anyways, slap your curiosity hat on and just dive in, rollerblades optional.
